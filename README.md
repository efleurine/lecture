## Theories

Reading is an important activity for young mind as it opens their mind to new worlds - new thinking and enhance their critical reasonning.

Reading is also an important activity for adult because it keeps us young and our mind vivid.

## The name.

For now the application is called _Avec un livre_ but the name is suggested to change one I release the first public version.

I am doing it like that because I am still undecided about the final name I am thinking about a creole name for it. But we will see.

By the way the application will be available in Creole - English - French, even if the beta version might just be in English for now.

## WIP

This is a very dirty repo. I still need to follow proper guidelines,
but still I think it might be usefull to some.
